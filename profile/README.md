<h1 align="center">!! Danger ahead !!</h1>

A vulnerablity have been brought to my attention, please refrain from using this plugin until this has been solved

I will be working on a overhaul to make this work with all client mods, as well as in-browser and standalone Discord, this may take a while as I'm not feeling well at the moment, but I will (hopefully) start working on it as a soon as I can

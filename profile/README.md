<h1 align="center">!! EOL NOTICE !!</h1>

As of writing, I simply don't have the time to manage this, let alone rewrite this, and with the lack of interest and ghost town of a database, I don't find it worth working on anymore with everything else on my plate.

If anyone wants to take over, DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kckarnige) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/634168893644210186).

I still believe in this project, but I don't have the time, energy, or resources to manage this anymore.
